## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- 🚫 Note: Homebrew is not supported on ARM Linux

- ⛑️ Git and zsh must be pre-installed

  ```bash
  # Ubuntu example
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install git zsh -y
  ```

- ⚠️ Homebrew cannot be installed as root on Linux

  ```bash
  # Create a new user if needed
  NEW_USER_NAME=alex
  sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G users,sudo $NEW_USER_NAME && sudo passwd $NEW_USER_NAME
  ```

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles
   ```

2. Run the installation script

   ```bash
   ./install
   ```

   If some files already exist, remove them first:

   ```bash
   rm -f ~/.profile ~/.bashrc ~/.gitconfig && ./install
   ```

   After installation, log out of your current user session and log back in for the configuration to take effect automatically.

3. Host-specific Configuration

   The system will automatically create a configuration file based on your hostname, for example: `~/.dotfiles/zsh/hosts/macmini.local.zshrc`

   You can add host-specific customizations in this file, such as:

   - Proxy settings
   - Environment variables
   - Local tool paths
   - Custom aliases

### Sync Remote Repository to Local

Execute from **any directory**:

```bash
dfu
```

This will overwrite the local repository with the latest state from the remote repository.

### Main Features

#### Package Management

- Uses Homebrew as the primary package manager
- Pre-configured with common development tools

#### Terminal Enhancements

- Modern command-line alternatives
  - `ls` → `eza`
  - `cat` → `bat`
  - `cd` → `zoxide`
  - `find` → `fd`
- Git integration
  - Beautiful diff viewer (delta)
  - Command aliases
  - Auto-completion

#### Smart Proxy

- Automatic environment detection
- Simple toggle commands
  - `pxyon` - Enable proxy
  - `pxyoff` - Disable proxy
- To automatically enable proxy on terminal startup for a specific machine:

  1. Find the corresponding host configuration file: `zsh/hosts/hostname.local.zshrc`
  2. Add at the end of the file:

  ```bash
  # ---- auto proxy ----
  pxyon > /dev/null
  ```

- If your machine has global proxy enabled by default but you want to automatically disable it for certain project directories, you can use direnv:

  1. Create a `.envrc` file in the directory:

  ```bash
  source_env ~/.dotfiles/zsh/aliases.sh
  pxyoff
  ```

  2. Allow direnv to load the configuration:

  ```bash
  direnv allow
  ```

  This will automatically disable the proxy when entering the directory and restore the global proxy settings when leaving.

## Common Issues

### Homebrew Installation Fails

- Ensure you're not running as root
- Check if your system architecture is supported
- Verify network connectivity

### File Linking Errors

- Check if files already exist at target locations
- Use `rm -f` to remove existing files
- Run `./install` again
